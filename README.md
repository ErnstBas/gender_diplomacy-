# Gender and diplomacy female EU heads of missions 



This is as very interesting dataset for those interested in diplomacy and gender. Collected by the University of Gothenburg, it maps the extent to which states appoint men, women and other diplomats to different kinds of bilateral ambassador postings between the years 1968-2021.

In this short notebook I will focus on the 27 EU member states. Of course, I am aware that the current member states were not the same in the beginning years included in this dataset. Some of the current member states did not even exist as independent states. For pragmatic reasons I did not make this distinction.

In this notebook:

1. Check the data
1. Select the EU countries
1. Visualise percentage of female EU Heads of Mission (HoMs)
1. Visualise which countries receive more female HoMs?
1. What is the percentage of female EU HoMs at G7 countries, China and Russia?
